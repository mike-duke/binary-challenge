# **Torcano**

TORCANO is a web based application built in React that allows a user to view an abrieviated list of news articles on topics related to child mental health as well as current headlines and be linked to an article. News data is fetched and populated via [The News API](https://newsapi.org/).

### Installation and Setup Instructions

```
git clone https://github.com/mike-duke/binary-challenge.git

cd into the 'binary' directory

npm install

npm start- say yes if asked if you should start the server on a new port
```

### Project Goals

My goals for this project were to:

- Utilize the The News API to fetch, store, and display article data
- Use React Router to add routing capability and navigation to different areas of the application
- Integrate Redux architecture as a global state management tool to access data on the frontend
- Test the application as close to 100% as possible, including asyncronous code
